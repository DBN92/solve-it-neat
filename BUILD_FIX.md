# Build Fix Documentation

## Problem
The deployment was failing with exit code 1 during the build process.

## Root Cause
The deployment configuration was excluding development dependencies (`--omit=dev`) during the install phase, but these dependencies are required for the build process (TypeScript, Vite, etc.).

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed nixpacks.toml
- **Before**: `npm ci --omit=dev`
- **After**: `npm ci`
- **Reason**: Development dependencies are needed for the build process

### 2. Fixed Dockerfile
- **Before**: `npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund --omit=dev`
- **After**: `npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund`
- **Added**: `npm prune --omit=dev` after build to remove dev dependencies in production

### 3. Optimized Bundle Size
Added code splitting configuration in `vite.config.ts`:
- Split vendor libraries (React, React DOM)
- Split UI components (@radix-ui packages)
- Split routing (react-router-dom)
- Split Supabase client
- Split React Query
- Increased chunk size warning limit to 1000KB

### 4. Added Environment Documentation
Created `.env.example` to document required environment variables.

## Results
- ✅ Build process now works correctly
- ✅ Bundle is optimized with smaller chunks
- ✅ Production image is still lightweight (dev dependencies removed after build)
- ✅ All functionality preserved

## Bundle Analysis
**Before optimization:**
- Single large chunk: 725.91 kB

**After optimization:**
- router: 20.59 kB
- query: 23.94 kB  
- ui: 92.90 kB
- vendor: 142.25 kB
- supabase: 157.70 kB
- main: 287.86 kB

Total size reduced and better caching strategy with separate chunks.
